              When it comes to Indian cuisine in London, there is no shortage of options. From hole-in-the-wall curry houses to high-end restaurants, there is something for everyone. However, what sets Colonel Saab apart from its competitors and making it the place for the best Indian food in London, is its unique combination of authentic flavours, innovative dishes, and elegant decor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike many Indian restaurants in London, which can be heavy on cream and oil, Colonel Saab takes a more modern approach to traditional dishes. This means that while the flavours are still rich and complex, the dishes are lighter and more balanced. Additionally, the restaurant is committed to using fresh and high-quality ingredients, and for all types of cloth cleaning, we use London's best <a class="text-decoration-line" target="_blank" href="https://www.nearestlaundry.com" style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit; all: unset; display: inline-block;">
    laundry and dry cleaning services
</a>
, which sets us apart from other Indian restaurants in the city.
            </p>

            <p>
              Another factor that sets Colonel Saab apart from its competitors is its stunning decor. The restaurant's Grade II listed building provides a beautiful backdrop for its exotic design and decor, which includes a stunning collection of art and antique relics from India as well as handcrafted chandeliers adorning the ceilings. This elegant setting provides a unique dining experience that is difficult to find elsewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
              In terms of menu options, Colonel Saab's innovative approach to traditional dishes is a standout feature. The restaurant's founder, Roop Partap Choudhary, spent a year retracing his father's footsteps across India by train, bus and car, accompanied by Indian food royalty, to recreate the exciting flavours that the restaurant offers. This means that the menu includes both classic dishes and unique creations that are not available at other Indian restaurants in the city.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, the restaurant's private dining rooms provide a level of intimacy and exclusivity that is difficult to find elsewhere. These rooms can accommodate up to 60 people for a reception or 26 for a sit-down dinner, making them perfect for everything from business meetings to special occasions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, Colonel Saab is a standout Indian restaurant truly proving to be the best Indian food London has to offer. Its commitment to authenticity, innovation, and elegance makes it a must-visit destination for foodies in the city. If you're looking for a unique dining experience that combines the flavours of India with modern flair, be sure to check out Colonel Saab.

      <p>Colonel Saab is an award winning restaurant dedicated to founder Roop Partap Choudhary’s father. Recently listed by Forbes magazine as one of London’s best Indian restaurants, this meticulously crafted and art- festooned destination was created as a "love letter” to his father (Colonel Saab) and family, as well as to India.</p>
      <h3 class='text-success'>Father's Day Menu Covent Garden</h3>
      <p>Innovative hotelier, Choudhary, is passionate about delivering the true tastes of India he enjoyed on childhood adventures around the country with his parents. The extensive menu is inspired by the places Colonel Saab was stationed at and Choudhary spent a year retracing his father’s footsteps across India by train, bus and car.</p>
      <p>Choudhary explains: "My father’s decorated military career led to postings across India, tasting an array of delicious and varied regional food, from traditional local lunches in the tents of Rajasthan to British- inspired Indian breakfasts in the Officer’s Mess and stunning banquets hosted by Indian nobility and Maharajas. Travelling with them as a child taught me so much about different ways of life in India and the powerful role food plays. I wanted to celebrate these diverse cultures and introduce the capital to the authentic flavours and textures, which are lovingly prepared at homes, street markets and royal kitchens across India.”</p>
      <p>Our exciting menu introduces diners to progressive takes on traditional dishes such as caramel and banana Paniyaram with Jaggery sauce at breakfast service, Doodh Maach - hake in Bengali sauce - on the A Là Carte menu, Dosas and Khaati egg rolls with a choice of fillings on the lunch menu and Smoked Duck and Mango salads or Kolhapuri Lamb Chops served at dinner.</p>
      <p>Show your Dad a good time on Father’s day, treat him and spend that much needed quality time at Colonel Saab. We've set a new benchmark in London, continuing a strong family tradition of celebrating the vibrant and diverse culture of India’s food and history with humility, elegance and originality.</p>
      <p>Why not make it an extra special occasion for the whole family at Colonel Saab's private dining rooms. These provide a more intimate setting and can accommodate up to 60 people for a reception or 30 for a seated dinner. Guests can also dine in or hire the mezzanine area, a space reminiscent of quarters from a Royal Mahal. For a combination of classic elegance with exotic art, the mezzanine is a perfect place for a Semi-private event within the aura of the main restaurant, which it overlooks, and provides a great area for an intimate gathering of up to 40 people.</p>`,

      <p>‘Where did Valentine's Day come from? The story and origins of it's patron saint are shrouded in mystery. We do know that February has long been celebrated as a month of romance, and that the history of St. Valentine’s Day contains vestiges of both Christian and ancient Roman tradition... Today, according to the Greeting Card Association, an estimated 145 million Valentine’s Day cards are sent each year, making it the second largest card- sending holiday of the year after Christmas.’ Read more…</p>
      <p>Each year The Choudhary’s are delighted to invite you to join them over Valentine's weekend – This year is no different and we will be celebrating with roses and special menus galore over the whole weekend, as well as on Valentine’s Day itself - Friday 10th, Saturday 11th as well as Tuesday 14th February 2022.</p>
      <p>Guests can dine in our extraordinary setting, described as a feast for the eyes, with a treasure trove of eclectic Indian art and artefacts collected by Mr Choudharys family on their travels. The experience wouldn’t be complete without the 5-star service brought to you by Colonel Saab's staff. They play an indispensable part in the evening's proceedings by bringing the decadent surroundings to life and happily regaling guests with the rich stories and histories of the sumptuous artwork adorning the restaurant. If you are lucky you may even get the chance to hear all about the love story of Colonel and Mem Saab. Will you be able to spot their love letters to one another?</p>
      <p>There will be an extravagant, love inspired, sharing menu featuring delicacies such as Sabnam ke moti (stuffed mushrooms) or the ever popular Tandoori lamb chops; then finish off with what we call ‘The Happy Ending’ or Gile-E-Firdaus, a dessert associated with love and traditionally served at weddings, garnished with rose petals and fresh berries.</p>

            <p>
              If you haven't heard of Veganuary yet, don’t worry we’re here to
              tell you all about it!
            </p>
            <p>
              A whole month dedicated to healthier eating and doing more for our
              planet. After last year's huge success, we are bringing back our
              Veganuary menu for all of our distinguished customers. Expect to see
              the mouth watering Jack fruit tacos back on the menu, due to popular
              demand, as well as more new dishes created for one month only.
            </p>
            <p>
              As most of you may know Indian cuisine has always been ahead of the
              curve when it comes to veganism. The earliest record of
              vegetarianism dates back to 5th Century BCE India. The ancient
              religion of Jainism promotes a meat-free diet. Jain vegetarianism is
              one of the strictest and most rigorous religiously motivated diets
              on the Indian subcontinent. At Colonel Saab we are strong believers
              in sustainability with our founder Roop Partap Choudhary emphasising
              this through his key practices carried out not just in his London
              restaurant, but also his luxury hotels in India.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It is great to see in the modern day the ideologies behind vegan
              diets coming back into popular culture as we all strive to be the
              best we can be, help others and mother nature.” - Roop Partap
              Choudhary

              Special Offer; Colonel Saab's traditional lunch tiffin menu
              2-courses. Limited time only.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-success">Vegetarian Restaurant Covent Garden</h4>
            <p>
              In India food cooked at home with care and love is considered to
              deliver not only healthy food but also divine contentment. Lunch is
              usually eaten thali-style, with a tantalising selection of regional
              delicacies that may include any combination of spicy vegetables,
              dhal, rice, yoghurt, pickles, bread and pudding served on a big
              steel plate or a banana leaf. The separate compartments in the
              tiffin lunchbox accommodate thali lunches perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Tiffin culture is now to be found all over India. Everyone – from
              women in brightly coloured saris working in the fields to giggling
              families on long train journeys – carries a tiffin to provide a
              compact, portable, homemade lunch.
            </p>
            <p>
              Enjoy Colonel Saab’s take on the homemade lunch box consisting of
              dishes such as jaipuri baby aloo, crispy kale & spinach, chicken
              tikka, chickpea chole and pilau rice with an optional sweet course;
              Rose gulab jamun with dry rose petals

    A Menu Full of Surprises
      </h2>

       
      
        <p>Our Mrs Doubtfire Experience Menu is a culinary adventure that mirrors the whimsical nature of the show. It begins with the colour-changing Chachi 420 gin cocktail, inspired by the Bollywood remake of Mrs Doubtfire—a film that has cemented its place in both Indian and UK cinema.</p>


        <p>
        Every course is a nod to transformation, much like the character of Mrs Doubtfire. Highlights include:
        </p>

    <ul style="list-style:none;">
    <li >
    •	Butter Chicken, reminiscent of the iconic Spatchcock Chicken scene.
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"My First Day as a Woman" Anglo Indian Chicken Chop.
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"Poppet's Paneer Pakeezah."
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"Hellooo!" Gutti Vankaya.
    </li>
    </ul>
<p>
To top it all off, the experience concludes with a "Run-By Fruiting" and a grand finale involving liquid nitrogen, paying cheeky homage to the movie's memorable kitchen fire scene.

      <div className="px-md-0 px-md-5"> 
        <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-6">
          Colonel Saab is set to expand its footprint by opening a larger, second restaurant in Trafalgar Square. Following the resounding success of its multi-award-winning flagship location in Holborn, the brand continues to elevate the London dining scene with its meticulously curated menus and art collections. Both of these elements are inspired by the travels of the Choudhary family across the Indian subcontinent.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">A Rich Tapestry of Culinary and Artistic Vision</h3>
        <p>Restaurateur Roop Partap Choudhary envisioned Colonel Saab as a heartfelt tribute to both his family and the diverse culinary heritage of India. The new Trafalgar Square establishment will feature a chic bar, an inviting lounge area, an opulent dining room bathed in the soft light of ornate Firozabad chandeliers, and a mezzanine level. It will also offer two exclusive private dining rooms, enriching London's luxury dining options.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Not Just an Indian Restaurant, but an Award-Winning Experience</h3>
        <p>Colonel Saab's credentials are impressive. In the last year, it has been recognised as one of Forbes' top Indian restaurants, awarded Newcomer of the Year at the Asian Curry Awards, won Travellers Choice by Trip Advisor and earned Harden’s Certificate of Achievement, among other accolades. Its distinguished clientele includes Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, pop icons, TV stars, and even heads of state.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">From Rajasthani Tents to Maharaja Banquets: A Culinary Journey</h3>
        <p>The Choudhary family's various postings across India, enabled by Colonel Manbeer’s military service, exposed them to the subcontinent's rich culinary diversity. From traditional Rajasthani meals served in tents to British-inspired Indian breakfasts in Officers' Messes, the Colonel Saab menu is a tapestry of these authentic experiences.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Innovative and Regional Specialities</h3>
        <p>The restaurant's all-day dining menu introduces a variety of inventive takes on traditional recipes. Highlights include British and Indian fusion afternoon high teas, regional gems like Sunday Lamb Curry, and signature dishes such as Falahari Curry Kofta and Gutti Vankaya—baby aubergines in tangy tamarind gravy.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Colonel Saab's Alcoholic Offerings: A Curated Experience</h3>
        <p>The drinks menu, created in partnership with the Diageo mixology team, complements the food with a selection of artisanal gins, whiskies, and rums based on Indian botanicals. Innovative cocktails are named in honour of the Choudhary family, adding a personal touch to your dining experience.</p>

    <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-5">In India, the act of sharing home-cooked meals with family and friends is a cherished tradition, as it is believed to provide not only wholesome nutrition but also divine satisfaction. Steeped in history and bursting with flavours, the Thali-style lunch offers a unique and fulfilling dining experience. It showcases a mouth-watering assortment of regional delicacies that vary depending on local ingredients and cultural influences. </p>
    <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-5">Each Thali-style meal may include a mix of spicy vegetables, dhal, rice, yoghurt, pickles, bread, and pudding, all served on a large steel plate or a banana leaf. The tiffin lunchbox, with its separate compartments, is designed to accommodate Thali lunches flawlessly, keeping each dish separate while preserving its distinct flavours.</p>
    <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-5">The tiffin culture has now spread across India, with people from all walks of life – from women in vibrant saris working in the fields to chattering families on lengthy train journeys – carrying tiffins filled with compact, portable, homemade lunches. This time-honoured tradition has evolved to become an integral part of India's rich culinary heritage.</p>
    <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-5">At Colonel Saab, we are proud to bring this authentic taste of India to Covent Garden, offering our unique take on the traditional homemade lunchbox experience. Our carefully crafted menu features dishes such as Jaipuri baby aloo, crispy kale & spinach, chicken tikka, chickpea chole, and fragrant pilau rice. For dessert, treat yourself to an optional sweet course: the delectable Rose Gulab Jamun adorned with delicate dry rose petals.</p>

        <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-6">Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is celebrated with great zeal across India. The festival symbolises the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. It's a time for lighting clay lamps, exchanging sweets, giving meaningful gifts, and spending quality time with family and friends.</p>
    
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">A Word from Our Founder, Roop Partap Choudhary</h3>
        <p>"Having been brought up in India, I've always cherished our festivals. Each festival is unique and holds its own signature dish that embodies its essence. Holi has Gujjiyas, Ganesh Chaturthi features Modaks, and Eid is incomplete without Sewaiya. The food is a major part of these celebrations, and that’s something I've felt deeply over the years."</p>

    <p>
    If you haven't heard of Veganuary yet, don’t worry we’re here to tell you all about it!  A whole month dedicated to healthier eating and doing more for our planet. After last year's huge success, we are bringing back our Veganuary menu for all of our distinguished customers. Expect to see the mouth watering Jack fruit tacos back on the menu, due to popular demand, as well as more new dishes created for one month only.

    <p>
      As most of you may know Indian cuisine has always been ahead of the
      curve when it comes to veganism. The earliest record of
      vegetarianism dates back to 5th Century BCE India. The ancient
      religion of Jainism promotes a meat-free diet. Jain vegetarianism is
      one of the strictest and most rigorous religiously motivated diets
      on the Indian subcontinent. At Colonel Saab we are strong believers
      in sustainability with our founder Roop Partap Choudhary emphasising
      this through his key practices carried out not just in his London
      restaurant, but also his luxury hotels in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is great to see in the modern day the ideologies behind vegan
      diets coming back into popular culture as we all strive to be the
      best we can be, help others and mother nature.” - Roop Partap
      Choudhary
    </p>
    <p>
      Colonel Saab’s menu already has a large variety of vegetarian and
      vegan dishes, and now our culinary experts have come up with a whole
      vegan menu with dishes such as Vegan dahi sev puri bed of crisp &
      spiced puff rice and Soya masala curry, chana masala, steam rice,
      roti to name a couple.
    </p>

    <p>The unique dining concept was launched in the heart of London by Roop Partap Choudhary, who meticulously crafted the menu and art-festooned destination as a "love letter” to his family and India. And despite being launched in a period which has been blighted by the pandemic, Brexit and cost of living crisis, it has not only survived, but thrived to be named one of the top Indian restaurants by Forbes, winning Best Restaurant in Feed the Lion awards and welcoming regulars from Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai - who says "it is the only place which serves the authentic flavours from home” to pop icons, TV stars and presidents.</p>
    <p>To celebrate the modern Indian restaurant at the grand, former Holborn Town Hall will launch an ambitious new Memsaab's Tasting Menu, in honour of Choudharys mother. The £95 progressive tasting menu will give diners the opportunity to choose a spirit or champagne, with each of the six courses being paired to a surprise cocktail featuring their chosen drink.</p>
    <p>Also to mark its first year, Colonel Saab invites guests to join them in the Indian birthday tradition of wearing new clothes and donating old garments to charity - every diner who brings an old piece of clothing for them to donate to our charity partner Shelter will receive a new, Colonel Saab t-shirt plus 10% discount from the bill, during October. Diners will also receive a complimentary amuse-bouche dessert on 1st and 2nd October.</p>
    <p>Colonel Saab owner, Roop Partap Choudhary says: "I wanted to celebrate the diverse cultures and powerful role food plays in India, by introducing the capital to the authentic flavours and textures that are lovingly prepared at homes, street markets and royal kitchens across India.</p>
    <p>"And I am humbled and thrilled by the reception Colonel Saab has enjoyed from Londoners over the past year and look forward to celebrating our first anniversary with everybody and welcoming in our second year with exciting new menus and plans.”</p>

            the past 2 years of cancellations, this time around the displays
            will be highly anticipated. The event is scheduled to take place as
            normal for New Year's Eve 2022. Hear Big Ben's famous "bongs" ring
            out at midnight, followed by the UK's largest annual fireworks event
            presented by the Mayor of London.

            the evening's proceedings by bringing the decadent surroundings to
            life and happily regaling guests with the rich stories and histories

            TUNDAY KEBAB (LAMB)
            <br />
            Originally established in the bustling streets of Gol Darwaza in the
            Chowk area of Lucknow in 1905, it was here that Haji – Murad Ali,
            more fondly remembered as ‘Tunday Kababi’ sold his delicious kebabs
            for more than a hundred years, and built a legacy to envy.
          </p>
          <p>
            MUTTON SEEKH KEBAB (LAMB)
            <br />
            Seekh Kebab were originally known as Shish Kebab and was introduced
            to India by the Turks (particularly Turkish traders). In Turkish,
            the word shish actually means a "sword” or skewer and the word kebab
            means "to roast”.
          </p>
          <p>
            SHIKARI RAAN (GOAT MEAT)
            <br />
            Traditionally after hunting in ancient times, people used to
            marinate the meat in forest herbs and cook the kebab on top of a hot
            stone. Typically, in the past meat like rabbit, deer & chicken was
            used.
          </p>
          <p>
            VENISON SOOLA BOTI (VENISON)
            <br />
            This Soola recipe is from Rajasthan in Northern India. Chef Sohan
            has been mastering it for years. An all-round paste is used to
            flavour and marinate the meat, made from various ingredients such as
            fish, shellfish, poultry, meat and even game.
          </p>
          <p>
            MURGH RESHMI KEBAB
            <br />
            Reshmi Kebab is a famous chicken kebab commonly eaten in India and
            Pakistan. It has Mughal influence which can be seen in the process
            of cooking using cream and cashew nuts. Made with boneless chicken,
            it is cooked by marinating chunks of meat in yogurt, cream, cashew
            nut paste, spices and then grilled in a Tandoor. It has a crusty
            upper layer and a soft inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            TANDOORI ROASTED TANGRI
            <br />
            Indian cuisine involves grills and Tandoor cooking, especially for
            kebabs, although kebabs are of Persian origin. Tangri Kebab is made
            using chicken legs. Tangri (pronounced as Tangdi) simply means the
            leg or drumstick.
          </p>
          <p>
            MEEN POLLICHATHU
            <br />
            Kerala style or also known as Fish Pollichathu is a burst of
            flavours of aromatic masalas. Our chefs pan fry this speciality
            fish, wrap it in banana leaves with all the spices and then roast to
            perfection.
          </p>
          <p>
            JHEENGA DUM NISHA
            <br />
            Fresh tiger prawns simmered in saffron sauce flavoured with cinnamon
            and cardamom. Dum pukht, which is a cooking technique associated
            with the Northern Indian subcontinent. Meat and vegetables are
            cooked over a low flame, in a dough sealed container with spices.
            Traditions assign its origin in pre-partition India to the reign of
            Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah (1748–97). The technique is now commonly used
            in other cuisines such as Pakistani and North Indian.
          </p>
          <p>
            KANDHARI PANEER TIKKA
            <br />
            Pomegranate, the key ingredient in this dish, commonly known in
            India as Anardana is used in a lot of North Indian cooking. From
            curries, breads, raitas and tikkas the seeds are used fresh or
            dehydrated. Dehydrated pomegranate seeds lend that required sweet &
            sour flavour in curries or chutneys. It’s the perfect souring agent
            lending that tangy slant to a dish from the Valley Of Uttrakhand.
          </p>
          <p>
            ZIMIKAND KI SHAMI
            <br />
            Originating in the city of Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh once the heart of
            the Mughal command in India. These tasty kebabs are said to have
            been invented by a chef to a great Nawab (ruling nobleman). The
            Nawab, having lost all of his teeth due to his general
            overindulgence, but not wanting to miss out on his chef’s culinary
            delights, challenged the chef to come up with a flavorsome dish that
            could be eaten even by the toothless. And so, as legends tells us,
            the Shami Kebab was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            DAHI KE KEBAB
            <br />
            Dahi Ke Kebab is a Mughlai appetiser that is creamy on the inside,

          <p>
            FALAHARI CHAAT
            <br />
            India is known for its street foods, especially its various kinds of
            chaats. Chaat menus change from region to region – i.e papdi chaat
            in north India and dahi vada in southern India. However, there's a
            kind of chaat which you can find in every region of the country -
            from extreme south to extreme north; and that is fruit chaat. It is
            basically a combination of various fruits mixed together with
            spices. Fruit chaat can any day be considered as a healthier option
            among all the street-foods available across the country, as fruits
            are superfoods, which are considered to be potent sources of
            essential nutrients.

At Colonel Saab, we’re dedicated to providing a multi-sensory dining adventure that now includes an exclusive menu inspired by <a href="https://www.shaftesburytheatre.com/events/mrs-doubtfire/"> Shaftesbury Theatre's </a> beloved comedy show and the iconic 90s film.</p>

    A Menu Full of Surprises
      </h2>

       
      
        <p>Our Mrs Doubtfire Experience Menu is a culinary adventure that mirrors the whimsical nature of the show. It begins with the colour-changing Chachi 420 gin cocktail, inspired by the Bollywood remake of Mrs Doubtfire—a film that has cemented its place in both Indian and UK cinema.</p>


        <p>
        Every course is a nod to transformation, much like the character of Mrs Doubtfire. Highlights include:
        </p>

    <ul style="list-style:none;">
    <li >
    •	Butter Chicken, reminiscent of the iconic Spatchcock Chicken scene.
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"My First Day as a Woman" Anglo Indian Chicken Chop.
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"Poppet's Paneer Pakeezah."
    </li>
    <li>
    •	"Hellooo!" Gutti Vankaya.
    </li>
    </ul>
<p>
To top it all off, the experience concludes with a "Run-By Fruiting" and a grand finale involving liquid nitrogen, paying cheeky homage to the movie's memorable kitchen fire scene.

      <div className="px-md-0 px-md-5"> 
        <p className="px-sm-0 px-md-6">
          Colonel Saab is set to expand its footprint by opening a larger, second restaurant in Trafalgar Square. Following the resounding success of its multi-award-winning flagship location in Holborn, the brand continues to elevate the London dining scene with its meticulously curated menus and art collections. Both of these elements are inspired by the travels of the Choudhary family across the Indian subcontinent.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">A Rich Tapestry of Culinary and Artistic Vision</h3>
        <p>Restaurateur Roop Partap Choudhary envisioned Colonel Saab as a heartfelt tribute to both his family and the diverse culinary heritage of India. The new Trafalgar Square establishment will feature a chic bar, an inviting lounge area, an opulent dining room bathed in the soft light of ornate Firozabad chandeliers, and a mezzanine level. It will also offer two exclusive private dining rooms, enriching London's luxury dining options.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Not Just an Indian Restaurant, but an Award-Winning Experience</h3>
        <p>Colonel Saab's credentials are impressive. In the last year, it has been recognised as one of Forbes' top Indian restaurants, awarded Newcomer of the Year at the Asian Curry Awards, won Travellers Choice by Trip Advisor and earned Harden’s Certificate of Achievement, among other accolades. Its distinguished clientele includes Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, pop icons, TV stars, and even heads of state.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">From Rajasthani Tents to Maharaja Banquets: A Culinary Journey</h3>
        <p>The Choudhary family's various postings across India, enabled by Colonel Manbeer’s military service, exposed them to the subcontinent's rich culinary diversity. From traditional Rajasthani meals served in tents to British-inspired Indian breakfasts in Officers' Messes, the Colonel Saab menu is a tapestry of these authentic experiences.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Innovative and Regional Specialities</h3>
        <p>The restaurant's all-day dining menu introduces a variety of inventive takes on traditional recipes. Highlights include British and Indian fusion afternoon high teas, regional gems like Sunday Lamb Curry, and signature dishes such as Falahari Curry Kofta and Gutti Vankaya—baby aubergines in tangy tamarind gravy.</p>
  
        <h3 class="text-warning text-uppercase">Colonel Saab's Alcoholic Offerings: A Curated Experience</h3>
        <p>The drinks menu, created in partnership with the Diageo mixology team, complements the food with a selection of artisanal gins, whiskies, and rums based on Indian botanicals. Innovative cocktails are named in honour of the Choudhary family, adding a personal touch to your dining experience.</p>

            DISCOVER THE EXCITING WORLD OF INDIAN SALADS AT COLONEL SAAB
          </h3>


          <p>
            When you think of Indian cuisine, salads may not be the first thing that comes to mind. However, at Colonel Saab, we are proud to showcase the exciting and innovative ways that Indian cuisine can be incorporated into light and healthy salads.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We have introduced the pomelo and plum salad, which can be enjoyed with or without grilled chicken. Made with fresh pomelo pearls, plum slices, cucumber, edamame beans, baby lettuce, and a delicious raspberry dressing, this salad is a feast for the senses. The combination of sweet and tangy flavours with crunchy textures creates a culinary experience that is truly unforgettable. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            At Colonel Saab, we are passionate about creating innovative fusion cuisine that showcases the diverse and exciting flavours of India. Our menu reflects our belief that Indian cuisine can stand alongside other trending Asian cuisines, such as Japanese and Peruvian, as a world-class culinary experience.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            We believe that Indian food is often misunderstood as being heavy and spicy, but we are here to change that perception. Our dishes are carefully crafted to be light, healthy, and bursting with flavour, using only the freshest ingredients available. Whether you are a salad enthusiast or an adventurous foodie looking to try something new, our menu has something for everyone.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            To complement our dishes, we also offer a selection of exotic cocktails and mocktails that are designed to enhance the dining experience. We invite you to join us and discover the exciting flavours of India in a whole new way at Colonel Saab.
